##Question 6
Given a list of numbers; if *pair(i,j)* exists, and *pair(j,i)* exists, report all such pairs. For example, in {{1,3}, {2,6}, {3,5}, {7,4}, {5,3}, {8,7}}, we see that {3,5} and {5,3} are present. Report this pair when you encounter {5,3}. We call such pairs **'symmetric pairs'**. So, given an efficient algorithm for finding all such pairs.
